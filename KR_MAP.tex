\section{Research question + design}

In this paper, we use an online experiment to study whether the distribution of risks one faces influences their willingness to take risks.
Participants can earn either a high or a low payoff by accepting a lottery, or a safe intermediary payoff by rejecting the lottery.
We use a Becker--Degroot--Marschak mechanism and ask them for their minimum acceptable probability ($MAP$) of the lottery's high payoff, $p$, for preferring the lottery over the safe payoff.

Participants make decisions in three different treatments.
They state their $MAP$ when $p$ comes from a uniform distribution, a left-skewed distribution and a right-skewed distribution.
We call the corresponding treatments `the Uniform', `the Good' and `the Bad'.
%When making their decision, participants see a graphical representation of a distribution over lotteries with two possible outcomes (high and low), but varying probabilities for each outcome.
After they report their three $MAP$s, a distribution is drawn and a lottery is drawn at random from that distribution to determine their payoff.
Depending on how $p$ in this lottery compares to $MAP$, their payoff is either the outcome of the lottery or the safe payoff.
By construction, in some treatments it is more likely that a lottery with a high chance of a high payoff is drawn.
%We use three distributions over lotteries.
%The distributions are ordered in terms of the expected payoff over the entire distribution, as their name suggests: the Good, the Bad, and the Uniform (the Good $>$ the Uniform $>$ the Bad).

We present lotteries graphically via 32 wheels of fortune with 15 sectors each.
Dark blue sectors symbolize the high payoff (\pounds4), light blue sectors---the low payoff (\pounds1).
The sure payoff is \pounds2.
In each treatment, participants see the wheels sorted in ascending order by the probability of the favorable outcome $p$, with the 32 wheels equally distributed over four rows.

  \label{fig:TheGood}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:TheGood} shows the distribution of lotteries for the Good treatment.
The number in each wheel is the number of sectors yielding a high payoff (ranging from 0 to 15).
The Uniform distribution has equal chances of occurrence for each of the possible wheels.
The Bad distribution has an overall chance of a high payoff equal to 0.2895.
The distribution in Good mirrors the one in Bad: its overall expected chance of a high payoff is one minus that in Bad (0.7105), it has the same variance and minus the skewness of the Bad distribution.
Table \ref{tab:distr} presents the distributions.

Participants are told that one of the wheels will be drawn at random, with all wheels having an equal chance to be drawn.
They are asked to state a \textit{minimum acceptable frequency}: the lowest number of dark blue sectors in the randomly drawn wheel such that they prefer to spin the wheel instead of receiving the sure payoff.\footnote{
We decided to use frequencies instead of probabilities because there is evidence that participants have an easier time expressing choice this way \citep{Quercia2016}.}
Specifically, they have to answer: ``Which wheels would you like to spin for your bonus?'' by inserting an integer between 0 and 15 in the blank space: ``I prefer to spin wheels which have at least \rule{1cm}{0.15mm} dark blue sectors.''\footnote{
We chose the setup with wheels of fortune as we wanted to make the task easy to understand.
Despite our approach being discrete, we interpret the frequencies ($x$ out of 15) as minimum acceptable probabilities.
}

%We use a within-subject design.
%One of the three decisions participants make (the three $MAPs$) is relevant for payment.

\section{Short summary of results}

We find that $$MAP^*_{Good} > MAP^*_{Uni} > MAP^*_{Bad}$$
This is true for between-individual comparisons.
The differences are highly significant.
Figure \ref{fig:MeanMAPs} shows that this is true for all treatment sequences.
When looking at within-individual comparisons, 44\% report the same $MAP$ in all treatments, while for 42\% at least one of the inequalities holds (for 38\%, two of the three $MAPs$ are tied, while the third one follows the same ordering as for the between-individuals comparison e.g. $$MAP^*_{Good} > MAP^*_{Uni} = MAP^*_{Bad}$$

\section{Predictions according to KR}

Referees suggested we use a reference-dependent model to check whether it could explain our findings.
We modeled utility following \cite{Koszegi2007} (KR): $$u(w|r)=m(w)+\mu(m(w)-m(r))$$
where $w$ is the outcome (which could be low, safe or high), $m(.)$ is consumption utility, $r$ is the referent and $\mu(m(w)-m(r))$ is gain-loss utility.
We made the following simplifying assumptions: $m(w)=w$, loss aversion is two-to-one and $r$ is the distribution of lotteries in each treatment (the exogenous part) including one's own $MAP$ (the endogenous part).
The intuition behind this choice of referent is that participants are correct about what they get in expectation for a certain $MAP$.

In the accompanying Mathematica file, we calculate and plot expected utility in all three treatments as a function of $MAP$.
This is a tedious (but straightforward) calculation because of the complexity of the referent.
We find that KR with the above assumptions predicts the opposite ordering to the one we find: $$MAP^*_{Good} < MAP^*_{Uni} < MAP^*_{Bad}$$

There are two possible options:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item We made a mistake, either in our assumptions or in our calculation.
 \item KR is not applicable in our setting.
\end{enumerate}
Option 2 is more intriguing, but begs the question: why?\footnote{
We considered taking $r$ as only the distribution.
This doesn't have an intuitive appeal: it reflects choosing a $MAP$ of zero.
In this case, KR predicts $MAP^*$ to be the same in all treatments.
